## Contributing to this List (Hacktoberfest Friendly! 🎃)

Don't know how to code? Great! This project is for you! We welcome contributions to expand and improve this list! This project is also a great way to contribute to **Hacktoberfest**. This project doesn't need any coding skills in order to contribute

### General Contribution Guidelines:

* **Read the entire list first before you contribute.**
* **Follow the Markdown format.**
* If a channel is in any way linked to something that you normally have to pay to see, and the channel is active and posts related content to it, then add it and write a short description of the type of content. 
* **Fix valid issues** by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
* **This list is sorted by A-Z**
* This list will **only focus on official YouTube channels** who have the rights to post the content online; **no unofficial uploaders are allowed.**
* Feel free to send links to other official channels that post Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, or Kids content. **Specify the language** if it's not an English channel.
* Try to keep the links in the format: `https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelName`.
* If you know of any YouTube channels that fit the description but don't have a description on this list, you can add one. You can also fix inaccurate descriptions or typos via a pull request.
* For content suggestions, **do not add YouTubers** to the list unless they focus on restoring and/or uploading **public domain content** like old movies and documentaries.
* **Do not add region-locked channels** that require a VPN to view their content. These are outside the scope of this list.
* **Each channel removal must be backed by a good reason in the PR, or else any PR with any channel removal not backed by a good reason will not be merged**
* Update your fork before you open a pull request.

Fixed valid issues in the issues section via a pull request 

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

Feel free to send links to other official channels that post Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, even kids content (specify the language if it's not an English channel)
Try to keep the links as https://www.youtube.com/@*ChannelName*
If you don't know of any YouTube channels that fit the description but still want to contribute, you can do so by adding some small descriptions to channels without descriptions, possibly following the simple formula via a pull request, for the channels which don't have one. You can also fix inaccurate descriptions or typos via a pull request. 

For people who want to suggest content, don't add YouTubers to the list, unless they focus on restoring and/or uploading public domain content like old movies and documentaries. And don't add region locked channels that require [a VPN](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn) to look at their content, I've had many suggested channels with lots of playlists which were hidden because they were region locked to a certain area. These are outside the scope of my list.
