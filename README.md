# Free Official YouTube Content


There's many official YouTube channels that upload full content for free, be it Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, Anime...

And I wanted to make an awesome list with as many of them as possible

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

[Originally](https://rentry.co/Free-Official-Youtube-Content) made by [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), now maintained by Superlincoln

💜A big thanks to [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/) for adding my page to [their list](https://fmhy.net/video#free-w-ads)💜

Also a big thanks to [all the members of the FMHY Discord server](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/FMHY-Discord) for suggesting me most of these channels

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

For people who want to suggest content, I don't add YouTubers to the list, unless they focus on restoring and/or uploading public domain content like old movies and documentaries

I don't add region locked channels that require [a VPN](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn) to look at their content, I've had many suggested channels with lots of playlists which were hidden because they were region locked to a certain area. These are outside the scope of my list.

For people who want a list with more miscellaneous YouTubers who aren't just official channels, check out this [Google Sheet page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZm5BcQTYJx8sfSuqHExHtIOPtSfod8beHKtYzp8DxE)

**Small Message**: Hi, I'm [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), the maker of this list, and I'm writing this short message to let y'all know that I'll no longer be maintaining this list, as it was taking a lot of my time and focus from uni, so i wanted to let all you know that I'm passing this list onto Superlincoln, which was already the biggest contributor for this list. The way this list is maintained will remain the same, or even be improved, since I'm not too good at organizing stuff.
That's all, I'll be removing all my personal comments from the list, except the few useful ones
