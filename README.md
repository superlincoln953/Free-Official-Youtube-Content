# Free Official YouTube Content: Movies, Anime, Cartoons, Documentaries, TV Shows, Sports & More
If you are overwhelmed, just scroll down to read and use the list.

There's many official YouTube channels that upload full content for free, be it Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, Anime...

And I wanted to make an awesome list with as many of them as possible

Discover free official YouTube channels for Anime like Pokemon, Cartoons like SpongeBob, Movies, TV shows, and more-no piracy, all legal content.

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

[Originally](https://rentry.co/Free-Official-Youtube-Content) made by [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), now maintained by Superlincoln

💜A big thanks to [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/) for adding my page to [their list](https://fmhy.net/video#free-w-ads)💜

Also a big thanks to [all the members of the FMHY Discord server](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/FMHY-Discord) for suggesting me most of these channels

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

Buy second hand Blu-rays(1080p/4K and lossless audio) and DVDs(480p and audio on par with streaming services) of the movies and shows you love and will watch more than once, they are cheap af, often have extra content, you can keep and watch it forever and no one can take it away.

**Small Message**: Hi, I'm [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), the maker of this list, and I'm writing this short message to let y'all know that I'll no longer be maintaining this list, as it was taking a lot of my time and focus from uni, so i wanted to let all you know that I'm passing this list onto Superlincoln, which was already the biggest contributor for this list. The way this list is maintained will remain the same, or even be improved, since I'm not too good at organizing stuff.
That's all, I'll be removing all my personal comments from the list, except the few useful ones
