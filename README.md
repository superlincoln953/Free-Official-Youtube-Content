# Free Official YouTube Content: Movies, Anime, Cartoons, Documentaries, TV Shows & More

There's many official YouTube channels that upload full content for free, be it Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, Anime...

And I wanted to make an awesome list with as many of them as possible

Discover free official YouTube channels for Anime like Pokemon, Cartoons like SpongeBob, Movies, TV shows, and more-no piracy, all legal content.

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

[Originally](https://rentry.co/Free-Official-Youtube-Content) made by [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), now maintained by Superlincoln

💜A big thanks to [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/) for adding my page to [their list](https://fmhy.net/video#free-w-ads)💜

Also a big thanks to [all the members of the FMHY Discord server](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/FMHY-Discord) for suggesting me most of these channels

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

Buy second hand Blu-rays(1080p and lossless audio) and DVDs(480p and audio on par with streaming services) of the movies and shows you love and will watch more than once, they are cheap af, often have extra content, you can keep and watch it forever and no one can take it away.

**Small Message**: Hi, I'm [Gordon Feetman](https://github.com/GordonFeetman0), the maker of this list, and I'm writing this short message to let y'all know that I'll no longer be maintaining this list, as it was taking a lot of my time and focus from uni, so i wanted to let all you know that I'm passing this list onto Superlincoln, which was already the biggest contributor for this list. The way this list is maintained will remain the same, or even be improved, since I'm not too good at organizing stuff.
That's all, I'll be removing all my personal comments from the list, except the few useful ones

## Contributing to this List (Hacktoberfest Friendly! 🎃)

We welcome contributions to expand and improve this list! This project is also a great way to contribute to **Hacktoberfest**.

### General Contribution Guidelines:

* **Follow the Markdown format.**
* If a channel is in any way linked to something that you normally have to pay to see, and the channel is active and posts related content to it, then **do not add it**. This list focuses on genuinely free content.
* **Fix valid issues** by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
* This list will **only focus on official YouTube channels** who have the rights to post the content online; **no unofficial uploaders are allowed.**
* Feel free to send links to other official channels that post Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, or Kids content. **Specify the language** if it's not an English channel.
* Try to keep the links in the format: `https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelName`.
* If you know of any YouTube channels that fit the description but don't have a description on this list, you can add one. You can also fix inaccurate descriptions or typos via a pull request.
* For content suggestions, **do not add YouTubers** to the list unless they focus on restoring and/or uploading public domain content like old movies and documentaries.
* **Do not add region-locked channels** that require a VPN to view their content. These are outside the scope of this list.

### For Hacktoberfest:

Look for issues labeled `hacktoberfest` in the [issues section](https://github.com/vighneshb04/Free-Official-Youtube-Content/issues) or contribute by:
* Adding new official YouTube channels that provide free content.
* Improving existing channel descriptions or correcting broken links.
* Suggesting new categories for content.
* Fixing typos or formatting issues in the `README.md`.
